**Spoiler alert**

This folder contains the solutions to the exercises of the [Machine Learning course by Prof Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). It is a rather awesome online to study machine learning. Feel free to use the material here according to the class's honor code.

I also wrote a [comparative review](https://medium.com/@ishakaursomani) of this and the [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course taught by Prof Yaser Abu-Mostafa of Caltech.
