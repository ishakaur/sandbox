# sandbox

A sandbox for new ideas and a starting point for new projects. I also use it as a place to play with and learn new tools and things that I know very little about but would like to know more about.

The current contents of this repo include finished exercises of the two machine learning courses that I took online:

1. [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) offered by Andrew Ng of Stanford on Coursera
2. [Learning from Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) offered by Yaser Abu-Mostafa of Caltech, initally on EdX but now hosted and freely available online, along with all course materials, including a user forum.
