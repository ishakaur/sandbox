# The Enron Email Dataset Processing and Analysis

This is my exploration of the Enron email dataset, which is very interesting  in a number of ways. The way email was done is quite different in fact that how email is done now. Anyway, the exploration in the two iPython notebooks will be interesting to those who are into this sort of thing.

In terms of the files, most of the parsing and data handling code is in _enrondatahandling.py_ and most of the analysis code is in the respective iPython notebooks. You will need to pass the path of the data directory to the data handling class to start the read and the parsing.

As always, feel free to reach out in case there are things about this project that you find interesting and would like to comment on them.
