# The Enron Email Dataset Processing and Analysis

This is my exploration of the Enron email dataset. The dataset is interesting with a lot of things to discover and the exploration in the two iPython notebooks will be interesting to those who are into this sort of thing.

In terms of the files, most of the parsing and data handling code is in enrondatahandling.py and most of the ananlysis code is in the respective iPython notebooks. As always, feel free to reach out in case there are things about this project that you find interesting and would like to comment on them.
