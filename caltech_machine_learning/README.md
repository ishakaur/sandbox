# Homeworks and final exam

**Spoiler alert**

This folder contains the iPython notebooks that I used to work through the [homeworks and final exam](http://work.caltech.edu/homeworks.html) of the online course called [Learning from Data](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) taught by Prof Yaser Abu-Mostafa of Caltech. It is a really excellent, and totally free resource, to study machine learning, and the homeworks and final are part of what makes it great.

Do feel free to use the material here, but if you are doing the course, then try to work through the problems on your own before you look at the solutions in here. The [class forums](http://book.caltech.edu/bookforum/forumdisplay.php?f=129) are also a good place to find discussion about the material if you get stuck.

I also wrote a [comparative review](https://medium.com/@ishakaursomani) of this course and [Prof Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
